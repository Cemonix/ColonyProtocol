# Colony Protocol

**ColonyProtocol** is a turn-based space strategy game where you start with a single planet in a connected node-graph star system and expand by conquering new worlds, managing resources, upgrading buildings, and constructing fleets of ships with simple counter-based combat. Each turn your colonies produce resources, fleets move along star lanes, and battles resolve when opposing forces meet, while an AI opponent races to grow its own empire, scout your territory, and challenge your control of the system.
